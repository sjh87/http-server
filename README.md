[Create your own HTTP Server](https://app.codecrafters.io/courses/http-server/overview)

I've completed every stage of this challenge, including the optional stages, up to and including the GZIP compression stage.

I might use this for something specific in the future, as it is very small and could be tailored to a single purpose.

For now, I hope it helps anyone who is trying to complete the challenge themselves.
